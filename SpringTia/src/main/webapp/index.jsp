Spring Tia Project.

    Tips: @Scheduled and @Async method. Example in TaskService.java.
    With the @Async we can pass parameter and return some value; in this case we need to call the method
    With the @Scheduled wen cannot pass parameter neither return some value; in this case we do not need call directly the method,
    the method is called automatically in relation with the expression (cron expression)
